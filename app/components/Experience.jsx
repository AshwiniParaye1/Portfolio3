          As a fullstack developer in ProjectBoard I developed applications
          using Vue.js and Golang, created REST APIs, implemented state
          management with Vuex and worked with the databases. I also
          collaborated on project management with Monday.com and followed best
          GitHub practices to ensure high-quality code through testing,
          debugging and optimization.
